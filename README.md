# digit-recognition
An AI that can recognize digits

Given an 28x28 image, it can recognize what digit you wrote

## Neural Network
I used pytorch to create the neural network 

The Neural Net is a feed forward network It has 784(28x28) inputs, 2 hidden layers with 64 neurons each and 10 outputs

## Data
I used the MNIST database to train the model on
